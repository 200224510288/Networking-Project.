# Networking-Project.
This GitHub repository hosts a networking project completed as a first-semester assignment, focusing on designing and implementing a commercial network infrastructure based on CCNA: Routing and Switching principles.

Project Overview:
The project centers on creating a robust network for a head office in Manchester and a branch in Birmingham. Both locations feature similar department structures, with critical administrative servers centralized in Manchester. The network design ensures seamless connectivity between departments and external networks via routers configured with Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) for efficient routing and failover capabilities.

Security Measures:
To enhance network security, Access Control Lists (ACLs) and strong password policies are implemented on switches and routers. ACLs control traffic flow and restrict unauthorized access attempts, while passwords protect against unauthorized configuration changes and access breaches. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is utilized to automate IP address allocation based on department-specific IP address ranges, ensuring efficient network resource management.

Key Features:
Network Design: Detailed configurations for head office and branch networks.
Routing Protocols: RIP and OSPF configurations for dynamic routing and network stability.
Security Enhancements: ACLs and password policies for robust network security.
DHCP Setup: Automated IP address allocation for streamlined network management.
Repository Contents:
This repository includes documentation, configuration files, and possibly simulation setups (if applicable). It provides insights into network topology, device configurations, and security measures implemented. Detailed explanations accompany each configuration file, offering clarity on network setup, routing protocols, security configurations, and DHCP management.

Purpose:
The repository demonstrates practical skills in designing, implementing, and securing network infrastructures according to CCNA: Routing and Switching guidelines. It serves as a resource for understanding network architecture, routing protocols, security implementations, and DHCP management in commercial network environments.
